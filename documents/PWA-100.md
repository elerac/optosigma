## Usage
### Initialize Connection
```python
from optosigma import PWA100
port = "/dev/tty.usbserial-FTRWB1RN"
polarizer = PWA100(port)
```

### Reset
Return to mechanical origin.
```python
polarizer.reset()
```

### Set and Get Stage Angle
Member variable `degree` is linked to the angle of the rotation stage.
```python
print(polarizer.degree)  # Get stage angle
polarizer.degree = 90    # Rotate stage to 90 [deg]
polarizer.degree += 60   # Rotate stage to +60 [deg] from current position
```

### Set Speed
```python
spd_min = 500  # Minimum speed [PPS]
spd_max = 5000  # Maximum speed [PPS]
acceleration_time = 200  # Acceleration/ Deceleration Time [mS]
polarizer.set_speed(spd_min, spd_max, acceleration_time)
```

### Run Any Process While the Stage Is Moving
By default, the methods that move stage (*i.e.*, `reset()` and `degree`) sleep until the stage is stopped. If you want to run another code while moving stage, you can disable the sleep process by setting member variable `is_sleep_until_stop` to `False`.
```python
polarizer.is_sleep_until_stop = False  # Disble the automatic sleep process
polarizer.degree += 180  # Start moving and go to the next process without the wait for the stage to stop
"""Run any process"""
polarizer.sleep_until_stop()  # Sleep until the stage is stopped
```
